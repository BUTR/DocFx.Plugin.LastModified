# DocFx.Plugin.LastModified
A DocFX plugin that adds a last modified date at the end of each conceptual articles.

# Binaries Download
This project is integrated with AppVeyor Continous Integration. Each build will be compiled and uploaded [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Still/docfx-plugin-lastmodified/build/artifacts).

In case AppVeyor removes the artifacts due to their new expiration policy, you may have to build the project yourself.

# Note
Please make sure you are using this with git source control for best result; otherwise the plugin will attempt to use the last written date of the articles from the local machine instead of last commit date.

# Live Demo
This plugin is currently being used under [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) [Documentation](https://docs.stillu.cc/).
