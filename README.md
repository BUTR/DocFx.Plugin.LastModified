# DocFx.Plugin.LastModified
A DocFX plugin that adds a last modified date at the end of each conceptual articles.

# Live Demo
This plugin is currently being used under [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) [Documentation](https://docs.stillu.cc/).

# Note
Please make sure you are using this with git source control for best result; otherwise the plugin will attempt to use the last written date of the articles from the local machine instead of last commit date.
